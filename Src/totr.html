        <p>
            The Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic or Sri Dalada Maligawa,(Sinhala: ශ්‍රී දළදා මාළිගාව) is a Buddhist temple in Kandy, Sri Lanka.
            It is located in the royal palace complex of the former Kingdom of Kandy, which houses the relic of the tooth of the Buddha.
            Since ancient times, the relic has played an important role in local politics because it is believed that whoever holds the relic holds the governance of the country.
            The relic was historically held by Sinhalese kings. The temple of the tooth is a World Heritage Site mainly due to the temple and the relic.
